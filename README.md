Capstone project implemented in AI Product Manager Nanodegree Program.

Business Value Starts with problem (not data)
We are often excited to use new technologies that are coming up in our project to solve problem. The key here is to recognize the value that the technology can add to your business value. If it makes the process more expensive and complex then it does no good. 
How does AI add value to your business? What data is needed? What is the scope? How do we measure success?
All these questions need to be asked to frame the business problem statement and see the potential of solution ideated.

This whole process involves 5 main stages:
1. Business Problem : Definition, value, stakeholder, priority, investment
2. Data: Availability, security, coverage, cleaning, augmentation, anotation, refreshing, pipeline development
3. Model Building: Feature extraction, hyperparameters, tuning, selection, benchmarking
4. Business value: Business value measurement, AB testing, versioning, business process integration
5. Active learning and tuning: Bias mitigation, ground truth, sucess monitoring and version controlling

Keeping all these points in mind the spam filter classifier project was formulated.
